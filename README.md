# networkInstability
network dynamics from homogenization to instability 


## Julia

Julia code used to  initilize the network and simulate the erosion

--simulation_main.jl__ is the main file
--QDelaunay.jl-- and --VoronoiPy.jl-- are helper functions for Delaunay triangulation and creating Voroni connections. --simulation_funcs.jl-- consists of simulation functions. The MatlabVisualization contains m fils used for visualization.

## Matlab

The Matlab folder consists of another version of the simulation written in Matlab. The main --main.m-- shows how to simulate different graphs.
